# Smart-Attendance-System-using-Face-Detection-with-Open-CV
 Smart Attendance Management System is an application developed for daily student attendance in colleges or. schools. This
project attempts to record attendance through face detection.
 This System uses facial recognition technology to record the attendance through a high resolution digital camera/webcam
that detects and recognizes faces and compare the recognize faces with students/known faces images stored in faces
database(CSV).
 Detection, Recognition, Updating record in Excel, Managing students data and faculty data through excel by the help of GUI
 Technology used: ML algorithm , Python.
 Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Face Recognition , OpenCV
